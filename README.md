## Crafting Interpreters

This is my notes and sample code to build an interpreter and compiler from scratch inspired by the book "Crafting Interpreters" writter by "Robert Nystrom"

Part 1 of the book builds a Tree-Walk interpreter using Java for a language called "Lox". 
It also discusses the basic building blocks that make up an interpreter/compiler. 
The basic structure or steps that takes to build this is beautifully explained by this diagram below:
